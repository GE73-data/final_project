## Team Members: 

Gloria Evans, Katie Blood, Ishmael Sandiford, Prince Amponsah, Nick Hancock

## Brief Project Description: 

Our team will be using publicly available loan application data from Lending Club and applying machine learning techniques learned in class to train a categorial model to predict loan approval or denial based on specified criteria.

We will analyze X years of data and, through exploratory data analysis, determine what of the provided information is best to use with our work. We will then develop multiple machine learning models and, based upon the predictive performance of each, select one to further develop and present.

## Team Responsibilities:

Prince – ML model development

Gloria – ML model development

Katie – front-end visualization and deployment

Ishmael – documentation and presentation development

Nick – front-end visualization and deployment, presentation development
